If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference. For example, The General Services Administration (GSA).

Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For example, NASA, NAACP, FBI. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writerâ€™s discretion.

We can now use GSA, but we can't use DOJJ.
